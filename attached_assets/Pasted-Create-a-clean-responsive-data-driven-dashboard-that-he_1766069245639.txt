Create a clean, responsive, data-driven dashboard that helps users monitor activity, track key metrics, and take action. Use clear hierarchy, structured layouts, and realistic sample data. Create a modern, responsive, high-quality landing page for a new product or service. Include a clear hero section, supporting content sections, and a strong call to action, with a polished, production-ready layout. which contains the following points: 1. Students can log in Each student gets a unique ID from the teacher. They log in with that ID + password. They can only see their own data, not others. 2. Students can mark attendance Depending on your design: Either the teacher marks attendance or Student marks attendance using their ID (with verification). 3. Students can view their own dashboard Their dashboard will show: Attendance percentage Subject-wise performance Assignment completion Participation score Behavioural trends AI-predicted risk level (Low / Medium / High) 4. Students can track their improvement The site will show: Graphs showing improvement Week-by-week or month-by-month trend Strength & weakness analysis Personalized insights 5. AI Recommendations Based on ML analysis, each student gets: “What you should improve” suggestions Study habit improvement tips Subject-wise personalized strategies Time management advice Alerts if they’re at risk of poor performance 6. Teacher/admin panel Teachers will have a separate login to: Upload attendance Upload marks Add behaviour notes Generate reports Identify at-risk students See class-level insights This project aims to create a smart AI system that doesn’t just mark attendance, but actually understands how students are doing overall. Instead of only checking if a student is present, the system tracks things like: How regular they are in attending classes Whether they complete assignments on time How they perform in tests , How actively they participate, Any changes in their behaviour or learning habits By putting all these details together, the system creates a complete picture of each student’s learning style and progress. Using AI methods like classification and clustering, the system can: Find students who might be struggling or at risk See patterns between attendance and performance Group students based on similar learning behaviours The goal is to help teachers by giving them easy, data-based insights so they can understand students better.
