Convert recommendations into checklist actions:

Example:

Revise Chapter 3 (Science)

Attempt 2 practice quizzes

Attend next 3 Science classes

When checked → system updates progress.

This makes the system interactive, not passive.

3️⃣ Progress Confidence Indicator

Add a simple indicator:

“You are on track 👍”

“Needs attention ⚠️”

“High risk 🚨”

Based on:

Attendance trend

Score trend

Assignment consistency

Very simple UI, huge impact.

This adds human touch to AI.

9️⃣ Goal Setting

Let students see:

Target score per subject

Progress bar toward goal

AI adjusts recommendations accordingly

Example:

Goal: Science → 85%
Current: 78%
Progress: ███████░░
